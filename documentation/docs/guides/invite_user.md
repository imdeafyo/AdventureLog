# Invite a User

AdventureLog allows for admin users to invite new users to create an account via an email invitation.
Invites are sent from the AdventureLog [Admin Panel](admin_panel.md) or via a custom invite form. The invite section of the admin panel can be found at `/admin/invitations/invitation/add/`.

Tip: make sure you have a working email setup for AdventureLog to send emails. See the [Email Configuration Guide](../configuration/email.md) for more information.
